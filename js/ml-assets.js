Note:
- Add new entries to the top of the array, that way the newest entries show up at the top of the page.
- LastUpdatedDate does not get used in the engine, just helps to keep track of when entries were last changed.
- Keywords is a string, not a list. Commas are encouraged for readability but not required.
- Only link to the original repository or the resource's original website, not a blog post or other middle-man
  page, unless that post or article *is* the resource to be shared.
- Entries are displayed in the order they were added to the list. In the future I may introduce logic to do some other
  sorting (i.e. by LastUpdatedDate) but this will depend on what the community finds useful.

    "Description": "(by Christopher M. Bishop) This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models to describe probability distributions when no other books apply graphical models to machine learning. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.",
